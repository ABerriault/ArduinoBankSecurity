# Arduino Bank Security
This 2 hour, software and computer engineering activity uses explorative learning techniques to allow participants to learn how embedded systems work on a small scale. Participants will create a simple bank security system using LEDs, Buzzers, Servos and Photoresistors to accomplish this.

## Important Concepts
- LEDs and lights can be indicators, used for illumination, or other uses.
- Buzzers and sound devices can create auditory ques for if something is ok or wrong.
- Servo motors move things to specific locations and are relatively precise.
- Embedded systems are all around us in our daily lives.
